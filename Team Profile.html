								<h2>Daniel Surla - S3729065</h2>
								<p><b>Website:</b> <a href="https://daandaav.github.io/S3729065.github.io/?fbclid=IwAR3w9FnI6P4j44eRkOt3LhGSvsYV1vbjUwFj1laHaHkMYQlabgHOhuozoFU">Daniel Surla</a>

how they work to store and manipulate information and I can program a chat-bot and
do a bit of web-development. I generally find myself to enjoy mountain biking and

 </br>

								<b>Ideal jobs:</b> </br>
								My ideal job is mainly low-level and high-level programming. Securing
systems containing information. Working alongside the client and the users as well
as other departments and teams. Consultants can also work as a project manager
working alongside the Information Security department and with employees with
similar skill sets such as programmers, and if our business employs a website we
have a website manager and websites also need good security, so Information
Security applies here.

Australia for my studies. I am really fond of computing and latest technology,
although I don’t much about them but still everytime I use them or anything, it makes
me think to work on that and to know about them. I am really interested in
programming even though, just a beginner in that. I don’t have any experience in IT
as of now, because I have just started my studies in IT. Beside that, I love reading in
my free time.</br>

								<b>Ideal jobs:</b> </br>

developing detailed project plans, the front-end of user facing products, translating
designs into functional prototypes. Working and cooperating with back end
developers as well to produce and maintain code. Moreover, it includes having
strong problem-solving skills and many other criteria. What makes me appealing in
this job is that it is a programming job and it will help in my career growth. </p>

								<h2>Oliver Hale - S3781403</h2>
								<p><b>Website:</b> <a href="#">Oliver Hale</a>
								</br>

								I’m Oliver Hale, I was born and raised in Australia. Since I was young I’ve
always enjoyed messing around with computers, I find the ideas behind it
fascinating, as well as the evolution from basic DOS computers to the graphics that
we have now. I enjoy rock-climbing and swimming in my spare time, as well as
playing with my dog, Zeus. In terms of my interest in IT I would like to learn about
security/encryption, machine learning, and networks. Currently, I have experience
with some programming languages and basic encryption / encrypted messaging.</br>

								<b>Ideal jobs:</b> </br>
								My ideal job is as an IT Consultant or solution architect. Both of these jobs
involve coming up with creative solutions to problems and interfacing with people,
things that I enjoy. Consultants also have the capacity to work as project managers,
organising groups of people to complete tasks. Having the ability to work with
people, travel (potentially) and use the knowledge and skills I acquire within the IT
industry to solve people’s problems make these jobs appeal to me greatly. </p>

								<h2>Duc - S3781251</h2>
								<p><b>Website:</b> <a href="#">Duc</a>
								</br>
								I am Duc Nguyen and I come from Vietnam. Since I was young, I was
interested in technologies, like computer system and others hardware. Later when I
grew up I decide myself to study in an area that I can work on computers and
developing hardware. So I decided to study I.T, which is not very new to me, I have
the basic knowledge since I was in high school and I learned more about I.T from my
brother.</br>
								<b>Ideal jobs:</b> </br>
								My idea job is Sales Support Officer, so it is delivering the product from the
sale team to customer. However I want to work around hardware and computer
system. So after i have the knowledge of which hardware is suitable for my clients
and which system I should recommend for them. I’m really good at communicating to
my customer, giving them the right option and make them happy about the product is
what I really want to do for the future. In order to do that I must be apart of a team,
working as a team is greater than working alone, because it is more organiser, more
secure and we can push working rate a lot better.</p>
