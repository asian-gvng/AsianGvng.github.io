									The IT industry is large, varied and changes over time. It also easy to get a misleading impression of what is typically involved on a day-to-day basis from a job advertisement or a position description. In order to help you understand this, the best way seems to be to hear from some IT professionals about their daily work. 	
									</br>

									Different IT professional have distinct work to be done as Information   technology is a very vast field and it involves various options such as Programmer, Database Engineer and so on. But a normal day at work,  IT professional at times need to be the project manager, at times working with others or getting work done by people and most of the times the main task is working on their own for whatever they are working on. As in, if the professional we have interviewed is a programmer so most of the times, her work is being involved in programming and making programs or working on projects which the company has taken as in, she is working in Melbourne University so whatever the project undertaken by them, her main task is to fulfil that.
									</br>
									Normally, IT professional job is not really that interacting, as the main task is not consumer oriented that means it is not a job like customer representative in which the professional have to involve with the tasks which has interaction with public. The professional we have interviewed mainly interacts with the other professionals, and at times with Clients as discussing about the projects undertaken. 	
									</br>
									IT professional does not actually interact with the general public as it does not have anything to do with that because that is not the task of professionals.
									</br>
									IT professional spend most of their time working on their projects as the interviewed professional is a programmer, so while interviewing when we asked about the time spent by her, her reply is in front of her desktop working for the projects. But, at times, she also has her meetings with other professionals.
									Normally, it depends upon person to person as what they find really challenging about their work. But as IT professional work involves working on desktop for hours, so what our interviewed professional found difficult about her job is that communicating with other, she lacks in that, as most of her work doesnâ€™t involve communicating at all so when she needs to communicate in some meetings and while expressing herself at work is what she find really challenging.
