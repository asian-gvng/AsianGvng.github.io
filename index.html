										<h3>Anisha</h3>
										<p>I am Anisha , I was born and brought up in India and then moved to Melbourne, Australia for my studies.<br>
											 I am really fond of computing and latest technology, although I don’t much about them but still everytime I use them or anything, it makes me think to work on that and to know about them.<br>
											  I am really interested in programming even though, just a beginner in that.<br>
											 I don’t have any experience in IT as of now, because I have just started my studies in IT. Beside that, I love reading in my free time.</p>
									</li>

										<h3>Oliver</h3>
										<p>I’m Oliver Hale, I was born and raised in Australia.<br>
											 Since I was young I’ve always enjoyed messing around with computers, I find the ideas behind it fascinating, as well as the evolution from basic DOS computers to the graphics that we have now.<br>
											  I enjoy rock-climbing and swimming in my spare time, as well as playing with my dog, Zeus.<br>
											 In terms of my interest in IT I would like to learn about security/encryption, machine learning, and networks.<br>
											  Currently, I have experience with some programming languages and basic encryption / encrypted messaging.</p>
									</li>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<h3>Arduino / Raspberry Pi Water Saving Tool</h3>
									<h3>by Oliver</h3>
									<p>This project will be an Arduino based water monitoring device that tracks how long a person has been in the shower (or using another water based appliance) and then can shut off the water (hot / cold / both) after a predefined period of time.<br>
										 The Arduino will also have the capacity to send information to a central system that informs the user how much water they have been using whilst showering, as well as how much they have saved or used in comparison to the average household.<br>
										  The user can either choose to have a separate screen that displays the information, or download a smartphone app to deliver relevant information into their hand.<br>
										The brain of the product will be an Arduino, connected to a reasonably large reserve battery, and then plugged into a wall socket.<br>
										 In order to activate the shower monitor, there will be a button attached to the outside of an air/water-tight container that the Arduino, battery, buzzer, and wires will sit in.<br>
										  Also, on the outside of the box will be an on/off switch, this is in case the programming inside the Arduino goes loopy and needs to be reset.<br>
										<br />

										<img src="images/project.jpg" alt="Life Saving Tool">
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="content">In order to alert the user of the approaching time limit of their shower, there will also be a loud (or quiet, depending on user preference) beeper or buzzer that goes off twice when there is two minutes left of their shower, once when there is one-minute left, and then counts down the last ten seconds in short beeps. In place of the buzzer, it would also be possible to install LED lights that flash at the designated times instead, for a less abrasive experience. </p>
