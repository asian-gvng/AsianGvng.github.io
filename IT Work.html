									The IT industry is large, varied and changes over time. It is also easy to get a
misleading impression of what is typically involved on a day-to-day basis from a job
advertisement or a position description. In order to help you understand this, the best
way is to hear it from some IT professionals about their daily work. 	
									</br> </br>

									Different IT professionals have distinct work to be done as Information Technology is
a very vast field and it involves various options such as: Programmer, Database
Engineer and so on. </br> </br>
But in a normal day at work, IT professionals at times need to be their own Project
Manager, working with others or getting work done by people and most of the times
the main task is working on their own. For example, if the professional we have
interviewed is a programmer, most of the time her work is about being involved in
programming and making programs or working on projects which the company has
taken. Currently, she is working in Melbourne University so whatever project is
undertaken by them, her main task is to fulfil that.

									</br> </br>
									Normally, an IT professional’s job is not really about customer interaction, as the
main task is not consumer oriented, that means it does not involve customer
representation, which are generally tasks which involve interacting with the public.
The professional we have interviewed mainly interacts with other IT professionals,
and at times with clients as discussing about the projects undertaken.
									</br> </br>
									In summary: IT professionals do not actually interact with the general public as it
does not have anything to do with them, rather because it is not a task for IT
professionals.

									</br> </br>
									IT professionals spend most of their time working on projects, as the interviewed
professional is a programmer, when we asked about how her time was spent in a
project, her reply was that she would sit in front of her desktop working on the
projects. But, at times, she also has her meetings with other professionals. </br> </br>
Normally, it depends upon person to person as to what they find really challenging
about their work. But as professional IT work involves working on desktop for hours,
what our interviewed professional found difficult about her job was communicating
with others, she lacks in that area, as most of her work doesn’t involve
communicating at all, so when she needs to communicate in some meetings,
expressing herself at work is what she finds really challenging.
