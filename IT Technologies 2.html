								<h1><b>Autonomous Vehicles</b></h1>
								<p>
									<b>What Does It Do?</b>
									</br>
									Autonomous Vehicles can
automatically drive for passengers without
the need for a human driver.
These are vehicles which interact with
internal and external technologies such as
other vehicles, Bluetooth, connected
devices, navigation systems, automatons
and other autonomous vehicles. </br>
Cameras and sensors play a big role in ensuring the functionality and effectiveness of an
autonomous vehicle. These cameras and sensors can detect and identify any given scenario
as well as learn from new ones, as machine learning can be implemented into this
technology. </br>
Autonomous vehicles can also replace vehicles (in the future), or even replace the public
transport system. </br>
The public and the country will be able to save resources and money compared to renewing
and maintaining a dated system. </br>
They can be employed as taxis, or be privately owned for leisure and recreation.
In the future we may encounter autonomous vehicles racing against one another. </br>
Autonomous Vehicles can also be employed in optimising road safety or traffic design.
									</br> </br>

									<b>What is the Likely Impact?</b>
									</br>
									This technology can help make the road safer for everyone. Traffic jams will become
less and less common, navigation through busy and rough terrain are made easier, and
people who drive to work daily will have time to rest inside the vehicle instead. </br>

Gas emissions may lower as routes are optimised, and electric cars combined with this
autonomous technology may have a great impact in cities with a large amount of pollution.
The car manufacturing industry will also be challenged by this new technology, as the public
leans towards sustainability and reduced gas emissions.
									</br> </br>

									<b>How will this Affect You?</b>
									</br>
									Autonomous vehicles will have a great impact in a person’s professional and
personal life. You will encounter less fatigued drivers on the road, due to being able to switch
from manual to automatic driving, which may also mean less fatalities. </br>
Pollution in heavily traffic congested cities will notice a decreased amount of pollution as
vehicles work alongside one another, and electric cars become more and more common. Lastly, newer technologies, especially personal computers and devices may have more
functions and needed tools when integrated into this technology. You may notice more
phone use as users ride as passengers rather than drive.

									</br> </br>

									<b>Robots</b>
									</br> </br>

									<b>What Does It Do?</b>
									</br>
									Robots have a vast range of uses in our everyday life.
The main purpose of robots are to make everyday interactions or tediums simpler and
easier.</br>
Robots can also ease physical labor or make monotonous work automated. You can also
have robots become servers, providing different services for different needs or wants, such
as having a robot butler or a robot cleaner.</br>
Robots can be also used in emergency services, especially in areas where no humans can
go, such as places such as Fukushima in Japan or Chernobyl in Russia.</br>
In example, Honda’s ASIMO is a robot capable of human interaction and articulate
movement. It can kick a football for articulate movement, and recognise human speech for
communication.</br> </br>
Or another example: Boston Dynamics’ Atlas - which is an autonomous humanoid robot,
capable of performing acrobatics and parkour, as well as long distance running, even Spot,
which is a quad legged robot which imitates a dog but has an arm with hands and an
opposable thumb.
 </br> </br>

									<b>What is the Likely Impact?</b>
									</br>
									Robots can solve problems or create new problems involving
robots.</br>
An example of a likely impact involving robots, is the advancement of
automatons. As machines learn how to learn, being able to
differentiate different scenarios, or even be able to measure morality,
will robots need to have protocols internally to ensure nothing bad
happens?</br>
Isaac Asimov’s book I, Robot - where Asimov talks about how robots
must have an important and priority level protocol in which a robot
must never harm a human being.</br>

									 </br> </br>

									<b>How Will this Affect You?</b> </br>
									Your everyday life will be affected. This may appear as hard science fiction, but
robots are a realized concept which do not have to be developed in a complex way. Robots
can automate even the most simplest, easiest and the most tedious of tasks. They are made
to make your life easier.</br>
Robot-human interactions may create new ideas, new technologies for personal and
professional use, and maybe improve human health and lifestyle.</br>
Although over the years, people have expressed their concerns about robots taking over
their jobs. This may be a reality that may someday be realized, but even if this does make,
for example: factory workers obsolete - new fields will always be made as technology
advances.</br>
