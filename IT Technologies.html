								<h1><b>Cybersecurity</b></h1>
								<p>
									<b>What Does It Do?</b>
									</br>
									Cybersecurity is a practice of protecting computer
systems from malicious attacks which may hinder or
maliciously control important systems such as systems
found in hospitals, emergency services or communication.
Cybersecurity also protects from theft of private data, damage to hardware, softwares,
electronics and systems
									</br>
									Cybersecurity can also be offered in multiple forms, such as softwares like anti-viruses or
protecting and preventing user-manipulation in the “Ring” layers which protect the lower
levels of an operating system. </br>
									Cybersecurity in a few years from now may encounter newer kinds of attacks or
vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown, which were a major concern for computers, due to
how lower levels of an operating system were compromised, security levels in which a user
shouldn’t have access to. </br>
Malicious software may also intercept software updates in the future, for example: Asus’s
software update, which was hacked and a virus was injected into people’s computers due to
a hidden backdoor access inside Asus’s servers.
									</br> </br>

									<b>What is the Likely Impact?</b>
									</br>
									As computers become better, faster and stronger and as old and new jobs are
becoming more technology centered, Cybersecurity is needed more than ever. The internet
has always been a Wild West for information and the freedom it offers, it’s easier now to
make a mistake and leak private data, and as more of the world becomes connected through
the internet, the harder it becomes to maintain and renew computer systems which harness
and process millions upon millions of information everyday. </br>
Cybersecurity offers many solutions to problems already known and experienced in
the IT world, but what separates Cybersecurity from your general IT job are the psychological
aspects of understanding malicious attacks and a deep knowledge behind computers;
offering solutions to problems not even addressed, or problems currently being brewed after
some good information gathering. The likely impact is that you and I are vulnerable to cyber
attacks, from client to server attacks to server to client attacks, Cybersecurity solves this by
creating and maintaining a system of protective layers between your computer and a
website’s server from unwanted interference.
									</br> </br>

									<b>How will this Affect You?</b>
									</br>
									The effect of Cybersecurity in this ever-changing world will affect you and your
family. Without your knowing your computer could already be infected with a malicious
software currently logging and relaying your every keystroke as you type your bank
credentials and private details into your computer. </br>
And with hackers (hacktivists, script kiddies, and professional hackers) becoming smarter
and faster in developing malicious software (malware) and all kinds of other viruses which
can log information or control a computer remotely, people with little-to-no knowledge of
securing their systems personally are vulnerable to even the most basic viruses.
People nowadays use social media to browse photos, but how many people know about
keyloggers being embedded into images? Or the fact public-wifi accesses are incredibly
vulnerable to snooping of media, e-mails and general internet browsing?

									<b>Small Computing Devices</b>
									</br> </br>

									<b>What Does It Do?</b>
									</br>
									Small Computing Devices are personal
computers (PC) that are small enough for portability
and handheld use.</br>
These devices work just like your everyday personal
computer desktop or laptop; able to run small scale
applications which require small amounts of memory,
mostly less than 50 megabytes, to be stored in your mobile devices.
The applications that run inside the mobile devices are developed to have user-fitted
purposes, ranging from calculators, calendars, document editors/writers, management tools
and fitness trackers, to games and multimedia players.</br>
Small Computing Devices also have functions for text-messaging, phone calling and GPS
navigation.

									</br> </br>

									Small Computing Devices will have an important role in the future, especially in the
classroom. As newer generations are introduced to technology, they will be learning about
computer literacy. Small Computing Devices are great in teaching children how to operate
them, they can be developed specifically for children to help with learning.</br>
Small Computing Devices can also explore different fields, from business to farming. They
can provide users the information they need in its portability. For example: Fonterra, in New
Zealand, employs smartphones to monitor the humidity and nutrients of the grass within
their farms, ensuring that their livestock are fed the optimum amount of nutrients. </br> </br>

									<b>What is the Likely Impact?</b>
									</br>
									Small Computing Devices are everywhere. As processing chips become smaller and
smaller, becoming the size of a fingernail, or as memory storage become small enough to fit
in your pocket, small computing devices, too, will become smaller. </br>
These can replace old technologies, such as your public transportation e-card, or even your
credit card, or be developed into drones that are micronomical in size, you can even have an
identification card inside the palm of your hand. Small computing devices can lead to newer
technologies. This is evident in Arduino products or Raspberry Pi products, or the new
Samsung Galaxy Fold or Smart Watches. </br>
Small Computing Devices can be implemented in many things, even everyday products such
as your earphones, toys and tools.

									 </br> </br>

									<b>How Will this Affect You?</b> </br>
									As mobile applications are developed to be compatible with modern mobile devices,
you will be encountering a new phone maybe every three to five years depending on
demand. You may be issued a company mobile device for office-work or for communication
for business. You may also need a new mobile device feature to make tediums easier or
automated.</br>
You may also need to purchase a new phone due to the early stages of development of a
newly released device, which may have some flaws that you, the user, will be disappointed
about.</br>
There are many reasons as to why this will affect you and everyone around you. The
security of an application or the mobile device operating system may in time be vulnerable
as mobile devices become better and faster, anti-virus software are currently available in the
market, making it evident that as more information are stored inside a small computing
device.
